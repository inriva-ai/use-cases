# Introduction

InRiva Use Cases repository showcases various enterprise AI use cases. Each use case is designed to solve a specific business problem using AI technologies such as RAG, agentic framework, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Each use case includes its description, major functional and technical requriements, design, and sample code along with instructions on how to execute it.


# Use Cases

## Use Case 1: Patient Note Summarization

### **Problem Statement**
In modern healthcare settings, clinicians face significant challenges in quickly retrieving and synthesizing patient data before a medical encounter. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain vast amounts of data, but their usability is often hindered by:

1. **Fragmented Data Across Systems** – Clinicians must navigate multiple interfaces to access lab results, medical history, and imaging studies, leading to inefficiencies.  
2. **Cognitive Overload** – Manually reviewing lengthy and unstructured records increases the risk of missing critical details.  
3. **Limited Time for Review** – Physicians typically have only a few minutes per patient to gather insights, leading to suboptimal decision-making.  
4. **Lack of Interactivity** – Traditional EHR systems do not allow physicians to ask customized, ad-hoc questions tailored to a patient's unique case.  

### **Value Proposition: Benefits of an AI-Powered Summary System**
By addressing these challenges, an AI-powered system that generates concise, interactive patient summaries can offer the following benefits:

- **Rapid Insight Extraction** – AI-driven summarization instantly highlights key clinical information, reducing time spent reviewing extensive records.  
- **Improved Decision-Making** – Physicians gain structured insights into lab results, vitals, allergies, and medical history, allowing for more informed and personalized care.  
- **Enhanced Patient Safety** – Early identification of abnormalities, potential drug interactions, and adverse reactions reduces medical errors.  
- **Increased Efficiency** – Automated summarization streamlines workflows, allowing clinicians to focus on patient interaction rather than data retrieval.  
- **Real-Time Interactivity** – Clinicians can ask context-aware, ad-hoc questions to retrieve additional details specific to the patient’s condition.  

### **Solution Overview**
The proposed system is an **AI-powered patient summary tool** that integrates with existing EHRs to provide an interactive, real-time snapshot of a patient’s medical history. The key capabilities include:

#### **1. AI-Generated Patient Summaries**
- Automatically compiles and presents a **concise overview** of key medical data before each encounter.  
- Summarizes recent **lab results**, highlighting abnormal values and trends.  
- Extracts and structures patient-reported **symptoms and progression** over time.  
- Provides a **timeline of major medical events** (diagnoses, hospitalizations, surgeries).  

#### **2. Clinical Question Answering System**
- Allows clinicians to ask natural language questions such as:  
  - *"What are the key findings from the last physical examination?"*  
  - *"Summarize this patient’s family history related to heart conditions."*  
  - *"What are the patient's previous surgical procedures and outcomes?"*  
- Uses **context-aware retrieval** to provide targeted, relevant responses.  

#### **3. Interactive Visualization & Alerts**
- Displays a **visual timeline** of medical history, lab results, and treatments.  
- Flags **critical conditions** such as allergies, abnormal test results, and overdue immunizations.  
- Provides predictive insights based on patient history and risk factors.  

#### **4. Seamless EHR Integration**
- Connects with existing health information systems to pull structured and unstructured data.  
- Ensures compliance with **HIPAA** and other regulatory standards for data privacy and security.
