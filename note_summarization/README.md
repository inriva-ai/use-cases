# **AI-Powered Clinical Summary Assistant**

## **Use Case**

Before a medical encounter, a physician or clinician should be able to quickly access a summary of a patient's medical records, gaining insights into their medical history, vitals, and other pertinent information. The system should concisely answer key clinical questions such as:

- Summarize the patient's recent lab results and highlight any abnormalities.
- Provide an overview of the patient's reported symptoms and their progression over the last month.
- What are the key points from the patient's last physical examination?
- Highlight any noted allergies or adverse reactions documented in the patient's records.
- Provide a timeline of the patient's major medical events and interventions.
- Summarize the patient's family medical history pertinent to heart conditions.
- What are the patient's previous surgical procedures and their outcomes?
- Summarize the patient's immunization history and any upcoming due vaccines.

The system should be **interactive**, allowing clinicians to ask additional **ad-hoc questions** relevant to the patient's medical history.

In enterprise environment, a production grade solution should address many different functional and technical requirements. 

The following are examples of some key functional and technical requirements to consider. It should be noted that this is not a comprehensive list of all possible requriements and its completeness depends on many factors including but not limited to enterprise technology stack, experience of engineering teams, standards & policies employed in the enterprise.

## **Key Functional Requirements**

### **1. Medical Record Retrieval & Summarization**

- As a clinician, I should be able to access the medical records of a patient and receive an **AI-generated summary** answering predefined clinical questions.
- The summary should include **vitals, lab results, medical history, medications, allergies, and past treatments**.

### **2. Interactive Querying**

- As a clinician, I should be able to **ask additional, patient-specific questions** and receive relevant, concise responses.

### **3. Alerting & Highlighting Abnormalities**

- The system should automatically **flag abnormal lab results**, critical conditions, and **potential medication conflicts**.

### **4. Contextual Timeline & Event Tracking**

- The system should generate a structured **timeline** of major medical events, including:
  - Diagnoses
  - Interventions
  - Surgeries
  - Hospitalizations

### **5. Integration with Clinical Workflows**

- The solution should be seamlessly **accessible within the clinicianâ€™s EMR system** and fit into standard workflows.

### **6. User-Friendly UI & Data Visualization**

- The summary should present **clear visual elements** (e.g., **charts** for lab trends, **timelines** for medical history, and **tables** for key indicators).
- Clinicians should be able to **drill down into specific data points** when needed.

### **7. Customization & Preferences**

- Clinicians should have the ability to **customize** what information is included in the summary.
- The system should adjust relevance **based on medical specialty**.

## **Key Technical Requirements**

### **1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework**

- The solution should use a **RAG-based approach** to retrieve relevant medical records and generate accurate patient summaries.

### **2. EMR System Integration**

- The system must integrate with **Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems** via:
  - **FHIR API**
  - **HL7 API**
  - Other industry-standard interfaces for real-time record retrieval.
- Ingestion of relevant information from the EMR into the solution must be done in either real-time or batch manner.

### **3. Vector Database for Chunking & Indexing**

- A **vector database** (e.g., **FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, or Milvus**) should be used to **efficiently retrieve relevant patient records**.

### **4. Tech Stack**

- The system should be implemented using **Python**. 

### **5. HIPAA & Data Security Compliance**

- All data processing should adhere to:
  - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**
  - **GDPR** (if applicable)
- Patient records must be securely stored and **encrypted at rest and in transit**.

## **Other Technical Requirements**

### **1. Secure Authentication & Access Control**

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** should be used for authentication.
- The system should integrate with the company's **Identity Provider (IdP)** (e.g., **Okta, Azure AD**).

### **2. Audit Logging & Compliance**

- All clinician interactions and patient data access should be **logged for auditability**.
- Logging should include metadata (**who accessed the data, when, and why**).

### **3. Scalability & Performance**

- The system should handle **high query volumes** with **low-latency responses**.
- Caching mechanisms should be implemented for frequently accessed records.

### **4. Explainability & Clinician Trust**

- The AI should provide **sources and citations** for retrieved information.
- Clinicians should be able to **click on responses to view original medical record excerpts**.

### **5. Deployment & Cloud Compatibility**

- The system should support both:
  - **On-premise deployment**
  - **Cloud-based deployment** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)** should be used for efficient deployment and scaling.
